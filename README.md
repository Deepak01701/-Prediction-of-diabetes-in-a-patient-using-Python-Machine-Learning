# introduction
One of the most critical issues that the finance sector faces is fraud. The fraud impacts the bottom line of a financial institution. It is estimated that a typical financial institution loses  of its revenue to fraud. If we apply this estimate to the Gross World Product of $79.6, the global loss during 2017 was $4 trillion (more than the GDP of India)

Machine learning models can detect such Fraud. The machine learning models can detect anomalies in the transactions and detect cases that might be prone to fraud. The machine learning models can compute faster as compared to the traditional rule-based approaches.

Machine learning models can map the data collected from various sources to the trigger points and discover the rate of defaulting or fraud propensity for each potential customer and transaction

# Problem Statement
### Define Research Goals
The goal of the project is to detect whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud.

### Data Set
The Data set can be downloaded from this link

The dataset contains two-day transactions by European cardholders during September 2013.

The dataset contains 284,807 transactions out of which 492 were fraud cases

Due to the privacy reasons, the dataset has been anonymized. The feature names have also been changed (V1, V2, V3, etc.). Hence, you will not gain much insights from visualization

By the end of the project, the learners will be able to learn the approaches required for fraud modeling
